# GRACKLE

Here, we present a novel NMF approach that applies Graph Regulari-zation Across Contextual KnowLedgE (GRACKLE) to learn latent representations. GRACKLE constrains the unsupervised NMF model using both sample similarity and gene similarity matrices. The model is flexible to incorporate multiple forms of sample metadata, such as phenotype or subtype labels, as well as molecular relationships, such as gene-gene interactions or pathway annotation.
